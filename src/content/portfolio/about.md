## Full Name: Saif Amr Samy Abdelrazek

I am Saif Abdelrazek, a passionate high schooler, frontend developer, instructor, and problem-solver dedicated to building modern web experiences and tackling real-world challenges. My toolkit includes HTML5, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Astro, Next.js, Node.js, Express.js, NestJS, EJS, BunJS, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Docker, Linux, VS Code, NPM, Git, GitHub, Cloudflare, Netlify, Vercel, Vite, Postman, DecapCMS, OctoDNS, and even Tailwind CSS and CSS3 (though I’m a self-proclaimed “Hater” of those last two!). I enjoy leading teams, innovating for a better world, and turning ideas into impactful digital experiences. Whether I’m teaching STEM, volunteering, or competing in global tech challenges, I believe technology and education go hand in hand in shaping a better future.
