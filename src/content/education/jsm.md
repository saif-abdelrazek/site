# JavaScript Mastery (JSM): My Doorway to Modern Web Development

## About JavaScript Mastery

## My Learning Journey

Since March 31, 2025, JSM has been my main resource for advancing my JavaScript skills. The channel was my introduction to both **React** and **Express.js**, opening the door to full-stack development. I’ve followed along with several of JSM’s courses and projects, learning how to build modern, scalable web apps.

I am still actively learning from JSM, especially enjoying the **Next.js Crash Course** on YouTube, which has helped me understand server-side rendering, API routes, and the power of the Next.js framework.

## What I Gained

- Gained practical experience with React and Express.js through hands-on projects.
- Learned modern JavaScript concepts and best practices.
- Built a strong foundation in Next.js, thanks to the crash course and ongoing tutorials.
- Developed the confidence to tackle full-stack projects and explore new technologies.

JavaScript Mastery continues to be a key part of my learning journey, and I look forward to building even more advanced projects with the help of their content.
