# Sibirbai Language School

## Overview

Sibirbai Language School is a local school in Gharbiya, Egypt. Although I did not attend the school in person, I was living in Saudi Arabia and took my exams as an abroad student registered with Sibirbai. This allowed me to complete both my primary and preparatory education according to the Egyptian curriculum.

## My Experience

During my years abroad, I studied independently and sat for exams as a registered student of Sibirbai Language School. This experience helped me develop self-discipline, adaptability, and a strong academic foundation in various subjects, especially languages.

## Achievements

- Successfully completed primary and preparatory stages as an abroad student
- Built a strong academic and language foundation through independent study
- Prepared for the transition to STEM High School in Egypt
