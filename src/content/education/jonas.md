# 🌟 Just Crossed the Finish Line: My JavaScript Journey! 🌟

I decided to dive headfirst into coding by tackling Jonas Schmedtmann’s Complete JavaScript Course — a 71-hour immersion into modern JavaScript, blending theory, real-world projects, and industry best practices. After months of late nights, debugging marathons, and way too much coffee, I finally completed it! 🎉

## How It Went Down

**June 2024:**  
I spent my holidays glued to my laptop, building everything from simple apps to the Forkify recipe app (yes, I can now code a project that finds dinner ideas 🍝). I got hooked on JavaScript’s quirks — closures, async/await, and all.

**September 2024:**  
When school started, I had to press pause. But instead of stepping back from tech, I:

- Taught myself TypeScript (static typing, with the help of elzero webschool course).
- Dabbled in React (because who doesn’t love components?).
- Joined NASA Space Apps with a team to solve space-themed challenges 🚀.
- Competed solo in Hack Club’s Highseas — an arcade-style coding game where I raced the clock for “doubloons” (virtual coins) and many more hackathons 🎮.
- Fell in love with Git/GitHub (commit messages like “fixed typo, maybe?” count as progress, right?).

**Feb–March 2025:**  
Later, I came back with a vengeance to finish the course’s advanced modules. Prototypes? Module bundling? Bring it on.

## What I’ve Learned

- ✅ Coding is messy. Progress isn’t linear — and that’s okay.
- ✅ Git is a lifesaver (until you accidentally git reset-hard).
- ✅ Balancing school and coding taught me to embrace the grind and the breaks.
